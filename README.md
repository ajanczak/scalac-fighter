#Run
1: `sbt ~fastOptJS`  
2a: In Intellij right mouse click on `scalac-fighter.html` and `Open in browser`  
2b: Intellij host files trough http. Files need to be hosted due to CORS. If your IDE don't do that for you, you must host project directory by yourself. You can use program like XAMPP or other.
